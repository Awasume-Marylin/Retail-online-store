  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
  Before making any decisions i first analyzed the data to answer the following questions:
  1) What is the seasonal trends of revenue for the year of 2011?
  2) What are the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue and quantity?
  3) Who are the top 10 customers?
  4) Which countries have the highest demand for their products?
 
  ### Results
  Based on the analysis i did to answer the questions above, i discovered the following:
  - There are some months which have exceptional high revenue than other. It starts increasing from september and then it 
   skyrockets to november which has the highest revenue of the year then decreases significantly in december. This is because 
   in december the data is incomplete.
  - The top 10 countries with the highest revenue are Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, France, Australia, Spain, Switzerland, 
   Belgium, Norway, Portugal. North America was excluded because it already ha very high revenues while these other countries 
   have potential for growth.
  - There is s significant difference between the top 10 customers, but revenues are still high shwoing that there is low 
    bargaining power.
  - Demand is high mostly in the European regions with few countries in the American regions, while demands are low in Africa 
   and in Asia.

### Recommendation

Based on the results i would recommend that;
- A new strategies should be put in place to boost sales in these region. This will increase profitability as well.
- Advertisement and collaboration with big brands will boost demands from their online sales.

### Limitations
The data for December was incomlete. This made it difficult to analyze or draw any conclusion from the month of December.
